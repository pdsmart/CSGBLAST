# perlblast / CSGBLAST
a Perl-Tk implementation of galblast/atfblast that uses the parport device (even via USB!)

A parallel/USB port GAL programmer which supports a wider range of GAL's than can be found in available commercial products. It has been written in Perl, runs on Linux/Windows/Mac (where the Perl eco system is available) and
along with a custom hardware design, CSGBlaster, which advances on the galblast/atfblast concept. The main project can be found on Kees Schoenmaker's repository: https://github.com/kees1948/perlblast.

This repository provides the design for an adapter to program GAL26V12 devices which being plentiful on Ebay (to say they went out of production a long time ago) but very little (ie. none) programmer support.
